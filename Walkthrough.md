# Unity House Project - Step-by-Step

This project involves constructing a simple house in Unity using only cube objects. Below are the steps taken, along with visual references for each stage.

---

## Step 1: Setting the Foundation
- In this step, the foundation of the house is created by placing a cube object at the center of the scene and scaling it to form a flat base. This foundation will serve as the ground floor of the house.

## Step 2: Adding the First Walls
- The first wall is constructed by duplicating a cube object and scaling it vertically to represent the height of the wall. The wall is positioned on the foundation's edge, forming the first side of the house.

## Step 3: Adding the Third Wall
- The third wall is created by duplicating the first wall, rotating it to a 90-degree angle, and positioning it along the adjacent side of the foundation. Now, two walls are in place forming an "U" shape.

## Step 4: Completing the Four Walls
- The third and fourth walls are added to the remaining sides of the foundation by duplicating and positioning the previous walls. These walls complete the rectangular structure, enclosing the space for the house.

## Step 5: Adding the Door Frame
- On the front-facing wall, a door frame is created by adjusting the height of a few cubes to be shorter than the wall. This leaves space for a door, marking the entrance to the house.

## Step 6: Constructing the Roof - Part 1
- The first part of the gable roof is added by duplicating a wall and scaling it into a long, thin shape. The cube is then rotated and positioned at an angle to form one side of the roof.

## Step 7: Constructing the Roof - Part 2
- The second part of the gable roof is added by duplicating the first roof segment, rotating it to create symmetry, and placing it on the opposite side of the house. Together, the two roof sections form the triangular gable structure.

## Step 8: Covering the Roof Gaps
- To cover the empty spaces left under the gable roof, additional cubes are scaled and rotated to fit neatly beneath the roof. These cubes are used to close off the triangular gaps between the roof and the house walls.

## Step 9: Finalizing the Roof
- After closing the roof gaps, the roof structure is complete. The final adjustments are made to ensure the roof is symmetrical and properly aligned with the walls of the house.

## Step 10: Final House Structure
- With the roof fully constructed and gaps covered, the house structure is complete. A final overview of the house shows the basic structure, including walls, door frame, and roof.
